# Data

Some example results obtained from the sklearn-bot. 
The columns are sorted lexicographically. 
The column `task_id` refers to the OpenML task on which the result was obtained. For these example files, the [OpenML100](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03731) was used. 
The columns `predictive_accuracy`, `area_under_roc_curve` and `f_measure` (if available) refer to the evaluation measure. 
The other columns contain the hyperparameter settings. 
The hyperparameters correspond to the [configuration space](https://github.com/openml/sklearn-bot/tree/master/sklearnbot/config_spaces) that was defined. 
Note that you can obtain almost all results using the script `examples/obtain_results.py`.
